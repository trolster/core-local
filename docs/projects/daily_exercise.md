# Project: Daily Grounding Practice (30-Day Cycle)

**Duration**
**Start:** December 29th, 2025
**End:** January 29th, 2026
**Length:** 30 consecutive calendar days

This project exists only within this window. No extension, no automatic renewal.

**Category**
Foundational / Time-boxed

**Intent (Why this exists)**
To test whether daily embodied discipline—minimal, non-negotiable, and unoptimized—creates internal stability, clarity, and energy over a sustained but finite period.

**Core Commitments (Non-Negotiable)**

1. **Walk to the sea every day (~25 mins)**

   * Arrival is the only requirement.
   * Duration, speed, weather, and mood are irrelevant.

2. **One strength exercise every day**

   * Exactly one exercise is sufficient.
   * Bodyweight is acceptable.
   * Intensity is optional; completion is mandatory.

**Constraints (Deliberate Simplicity)**

* No tracking tools or metrics with the exception being the log.
* No optimization or progression planning.
* No stacking additional habits onto this project.
* No compensating for missed days.

**Success Criteria**

* Binary, per day: done / not done.
* The project succeeds if the rules are followed for the full 30-day window, regardless of “quality.”

**Failure Mode to Watch For**

* Turning the month into a fitness challenge.
* Adding evaluation during the month instead of after.
* Skipping a day because it feels “symbolically broken.”

**Recovery Rule**
If a day is missed:
Resume the next day without adjustment, explanation, or self-correction.

**Closure Rule (Important)**
At the end of the month:

* The project **ends automatically**.
* No continuation decision is made for at least 48 hours.
* Only then may you evaluate whether to:

  * repeat,
  * modify,
  * elevate to a keystone practice,
  * or discard entirely.

**Identity Statement (Active for 30 days only)**
“For this month, I am someone who touches the sea and loads my body every day.”

This time-boxing is important: it keeps the project **clean, finite, and honest**.
You are not promising a better future version of yourself—only disciplined presence for 30 days.
