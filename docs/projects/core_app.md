# CORE App

## Rules

This project must respect the contraints that are set in the c_main.md file.
It should be a normal web app running on localhost. No login. Just my personal project.
It should be something I'm able to complete in a few weeks of work.

**Duration**
**Start:** 
**End:** 
**Length:** 

**Category**
Skill Restoration / Tooling / Personal Infrastructure

**One Deliverable**
A **local-only web app** ("CORE Workbench") that lets me **maintain, navigate, and refine my CORE system**, including structured editing across categories and integrated AI assistance.

If the app exists and I can use it daily to work my CORE content, the project is complete.

## Purpose

This project is a single, practical vehicle for getting back into coding without building something disposable. The work should continuously pay back by becoming the place I actually manage CORE.

This is not a portfolio product and not a public SaaS. It is a private instrument.

---

## Scope

### Core user outcome

I can sit down, open the app locally, and do real CORE work quickly:

* review my current state
* update projects and practices
* add, restructure, and refine text
* keep material coherent over time

### What “local-only” means

* Runs on my machine
* Data stored locally
* No public hosting, no multi-user, no sign-up flows

(External AI APIs may be used, but the app itself remains local and private.)

---

## Success Criteria

The project is complete when:

1. The app runs locally in a repeatable way
2. I can manage CORE categories and items through the UI
3. I can apply AI assistance to transform or refine CORE content with explicit accept/reject control
4. I use it to update at least one real CORE item end-to-end (create → refine → save → revisit)

---

## Definition of Done

A working local web app that I actively use for CORE work, providing:

* structured navigation of CORE content
* fast editing and revision
* AI-assisted refinement that proposes changes rather than silently applying them
* persistent local storage
* basic visibility into change history (timestamps or snapshots)

When these conditions are met, the project is finished.
