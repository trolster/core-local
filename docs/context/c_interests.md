## INTERESTS

This section captures the intellectual "fuel" and curiosity that support my ability to remain "Awake" (D1) and provide context for my creative work.

**Intellectual Frameworks**
*   **Foundational Physics:** I am fascinated by how the universe works at its most basic level, with a current focus on the Wolfram Physics Project and its computational approach to reality.
*   **History:** I am currently studying the history of the Roman Empire, seeking to understand the long-term patterns of civilization, power, and collapse.
*   **World Politics:** I focus on global affairs and geopolitical shifts rather than local Danish politics, seeking to understand the larger forces that shape human outcomes.

**Global Security & Awareness**
*   **The War in Ukraine:** I view the 2022 invasion as the most significant event of my lifetime in Europe. I am deeply interested in the survival of Ukraine as a prerequisite for European security and am concerned by the revisionist narrative of the Russian state.

**Emerging Technologies**
*   **Artificial Intelligence:** I view AI as the most significant invention in human history—on par with fire. I am interested in how it can be used for personal empowerment, thought structuring, and the democratization of high-level engineering.
*   **3D Printing:** I see this as a critical production paradigm for the next decade. I am interested in how it can democratize manufacturing and allow individuals to manifest physical objects as easily as software.
