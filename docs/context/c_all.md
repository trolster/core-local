# Context for the CORE project

## HISTORY

- Born in Helsingør, Denmark, on December 25th, 1972.
- Attended Helsingør Lilleskole followed by Sortedam Gymnasium in Copenhagen after moving at age 14.
- Childhood was marked by a severe fear of sleeping away from home and a persistent dislike of formal schooling beginning in 4th grade; I have always preferred independent study.
- Experienced severe depression throughout my 20s.
- Spent my 30s reinventing my identity and social circles, shifting away from my former life.
- Entered Software Development in my 40s, progressing from Frontend Developer to Frontend Manager and eventually Head of Frontend.
- In 2016, I successfully built and shipped an open-source software tool that achieved genuine public utility.
- Purchased a dilapidated house in Køge in February 2022, intending to renovate it while living in it.

### TRAUMAS

- I was born with jaundice and lay alone for the first couple of weeks of my life.
- I would get panic attacks as a child when I had to go to camp. I was sent anyway and expected to toughen up.
- I had a few bad break-ups that really killed my belief in long-term relationships.

## CURRENT STATUS

- **Personal:** 53, male, single, and in relatively good health. I have a sister (55), a niece (14), and elderly parents (82 and 88).
- **Professional:** I was let go due to corporate restructuring in August 2025; my employment officially ended on December 1st. I am currently navigating a pivot from Engineering Management back to individual contribution, with the goal of transitioning from Frontend to AI Engineering.
- **Financial:** I am financially competent and secure for at least the next 7 months due to insurance and disciplined saving. My primary objective is to build a personal product and establish an independent income stream.
- **Environmental:** I am living in the Køge house. Renovation has stalled due to a lack of energy and resources, and the environment does not yet function as the sanctuary I envision.
- **State of Mind:** I am re-engaging with programming but finding it difficult to sustain drive without a clear, compounding direction. I am currently focused on using AI to structure my thoughts and prioritize the creation of a tangible, shipped product.

## INTERESTS

This section captures the intellectual "fuel" and curiosity that support my ability to remain "Awake" (D1) and provide context for my creative work.

### Intellectual Frameworks

- **Foundational Physics:** I am fascinated by how the universe works at its most basic level, with a current focus on the Wolfram Physics Project and its computational approach to reality.
- **History:** I am currently studying the history of the Roman Empire, seeking to understand the long-term patterns of civilization, power, and collapse.
- **World Politics:** I focus on global affairs and geopolitical shifts rather than local Danish politics, seeking to understand the larger forces that shape human outcomes.

### Global Security & Awareness

- **The War in Ukraine:** I view the 2022 invasion as the most significant event of my lifetime in Europe. I am deeply interested in the survival of Ukraine as a prerequisite for European security and am concerned by the revisionist narrative of the Russian state.

### Emerging Technologies

- **Artificial Intelligence:** I view AI as the most significant invention in human history—on par with fire. I am interested in how it can be used for personal empowerment, thought structuring, and the democratization of high-level engineering.
- **3D Printing:** I see this as a critical production paradigm for the next decade. I am interested in how it can democratize manufacturing and allow individuals to manifest physical objects as easily as software.

## IDEAS

- I1: If people are in full control of their money they will be more productive and happy.
- I2: AI should curate my content, to filter out the fake and the pointless stuff.
- I3: Belief is far more powerful than facts.

## PREDICTIONS

- China attacks Taiwan by end of 2027 (80%)
- Google wins the race to AGI by 2028 (50%)

## THINGS I'VE BEEN WRONG ABOUT

- Thought people would realize how bad Facebook is.
- I thought I could renovate my house in a year.
- In my 20s I thought I wasn't a competitive person. I was just scared of losing.
- I thought I'd get into woodworking if I had a workshop and tools, but its not really happened.
- I thought I'd start a business in 8 years, and now its been 10.

## WISDOM

- Who am I -> What am I -> What is life -> What is the universe
- The magic you're looking for is in the work you're avoiding.
- In practice, weak people behave very similarly to evil people. Don't tie yourself to either.
- When I am feeling low mood or low energy, 95% of the time it's because I have not 1) gotten up early, 2) gotten outside, 3) worked out, 4) gone for a walk, or done anything else physical in the last 2 days. Just go do that, and you'll instantly feel better.
