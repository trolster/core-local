- Childhood was marked by a severe fear of sleeping away from home and a persistent dislike of formal schooling beginning in 4th grade; I have always preferred independent study.

- Spent my 30s reinventing my identity and social circles, shifting away from my former life.

## TRAUMAS

- I was born with jaundice and lay alone for the first couple of weeks of my life.
- I would get panic attacks as a child when I had to go to camp. I was sent anyway and expected to toughen up.
- I had a few bad break-ups that really killed my belief in long-term relationships.
