# CURRENT STATUS

- **Personal:** 53, male, single, and in relatively good health. I have a sister (55), a niece (14), and elderly parents (82 and 88).
- **Professional:** I was let go due to corporate restructuring in August 2025; my employment officially ended on December 1st. I am currently navigating a pivot from Engineering Management back to individual contribution, with the goal of transitioning from Frontend to AI Engineering.
- **Financial:** I am financially competent and secure for at least the next 7 months due to insurance and disciplined saving. My primary objective is to build a personal product and establish an independent income stream.
- **Environmental:** I am living in the Køge house. Renovation has stalled due to a lack of energy and resources, and the environment does not yet function as the sanctuary I envision.
- **State of Mind:** I am re-engaging with programming but finding it difficult to sustain drive without a clear, compounding direction. I am currently focused on using AI to structure my thoughts and prioritize the creation of a tangible, shipped product.
