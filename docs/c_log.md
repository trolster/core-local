- Got up late. Not feeling so well. Slept 12 hours.
- Spent time on a video interview with Professor Hugh White - "Our new “multipolar” future, split between American, Chinese, Russian, Indian, and European spheres of influence, is a “darker world” than the golden age of US dominance. But Hugh’s message is blunt: for better or worse, 35 years of American hegemony are over. The challenge now is managing the transition peacefully." Great video that I finished in bites.
