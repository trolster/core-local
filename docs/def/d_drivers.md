# DRIVERS

## Purpose

Drivers define the **conditions under which my life feels real, meaningful, and legitimate**.

They are *not* goals and they are not moral rules. They are the system’s **operating requirements**: when they are met, I tend to engage freely and coherently with life; when they are violated, I predictably drift, harden, or collapse.

A driver answers:

> **“What must be continuously true for me to be awake, capable, and open to life?”**

## What Drivers Do

1. **Enable engagement**
   Drivers describe what restores aliveness, agency, and openness. They are not only about preventing failure; they specify the conditions that make full participation possible.

2. **Define legitimacy**
   Any goal or project is legitimate only if both its pursuit and its outcomes respect the drivers. Progress that violates them is treated as false progress.

3. **Expose tradeoffs**
   Drivers make costs explicit. Because time, energy, and attention are finite, choosing one way of living excludes others. Drivers clarify which tradeoffs are acceptable.

4. **Stabilize coherence over time**
   Drivers are stable. They allow goals and projects to change without losing integrity, because the operating requirements remain constant.

## What Drivers Are Not

* Not outcomes (no finish line)
* Not identity claims (“I am the kind of person who…”)
* Not strategies/constraints (no triggers or enforcement rules)
* Not metrics

Drivers are **conditions**, not achievements.

## “Drivers Define What Life Costs” (and What Life Enables)

Every life pays a price: in time, attention, energy, integrity, health, and relationship. Violating a driver may produce short-term gains, but it accumulates debt (fatigue, resentment, confusion, isolation).

At the same time, drivers are not only about sacrifice. They are also about **what becomes possible** when the costs are paid: clarity, capacity, ownership, and closeness.

A practical reframe:

* **Drivers define what I refuse to pay unconsciously.**
* **Drivers define what I want to be able to access consistently.**

---

## Relationship to Other CORE Elements

* **Drivers**: operating requirements (what must be true)
* **Problems**: where those requirements are currently violated
* **Challenges**: recurring failure modes that block consistency
* **Constraints**: trigger-based rules that protect the drivers under stress
* **Goals/Projects**: commitments and work that must remain driver-legitimate

If a goal conflicts with a driver, the goal is illegitimate by definition.

## Design Principles

Drivers should be:

* Few
* Stable across time
* Expensive to violate
* Easy to recognize when broken

If a condition can be ignored repeatedly without consequence, it is not a driver.
