# CORE

CORE is a tool for maintaining explainable, legitimate, and coherent action across time.
It is an operating structure that helps to understand what I am doing, why I am doing it, and whether it belongs — at any moment.

It provides:
- Explainability: the ability to trace actions and projects back to drivers and missions
- Legitimacy: clear constraints on what kinds of actions are worth taking
- Generativity: a framework for defining new goals and projects without drift or self-deception
- Continuity: mechanisms that allow effort to compound into a coherent life rather than fragment

## What CORE is not

- CORE is not perfect. Even after years of working on it, it will only contain some reasonable approximation of who you are. It is not your lived reality. For instance, you might think that getting a DRIVER wrong could cause a catastrofic collapse of the CORE, but it should rather reveal itself as you find yourself in conflict with it, thus spurring change and understanding.
- **CORE is not a productivity system and not a philosophy.**
- CORE is not an escape into psycho-babble. It is not expansive, and it only contains what is needed for **useful** guidance.
- CORE is not a personality test. While it explains your actions through a boiled down set of drivers, missions and rules, it does not try to fit you into a type.
- CORE is not a sure-fire way to stop lying to yourself. Its a way to recover explainability from action to drivers, whether those drivers and actions are truthful or not.
