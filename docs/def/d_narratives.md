# NARRATIVES

## Purpose

Narratives define the **working stories** I use to understand myself and to communicate who I am to others.

They are not aspirations, branding, or identity construction. Narratives exist to **stabilize coherence**, reduce fragmentation, and allow truthful communication without over‑disclosure or self‑distortion.

A narrative answers:

> **“How do I explain what I am doing and why, in a way that is accurate, grounded, and sustainable?”**

## What Narratives Do

1. **Maintain Internal Coherence**
   Narratives provide a stable frame that connects current actions to missions and drivers. They prevent constant re‑interpretation of the self every time circumstances change.

2. **Enable Honest External Communication**
   Narratives allow me to speak about my life and work without exaggeration, defensiveness, or unnecessary complexity. They are socially legible without being performative.

3. **Reduce Cognitive and Emotional Load**
   By having a small set of ready narratives, I avoid repeatedly renegotiating who I am or what I am about in each interaction.

4. **Prevent Drift and Self‑Deception**
   Narratives act as mirrors. If my actions stop matching my narratives, the mismatch becomes visible quickly.

## What Narratives Are Not

Narratives are **not**:

* Goals or plans
* Values or virtues
* Fixed identities
* Personal mythology
* Optimized self‑presentation

Narratives are allowed to change as reality changes. They should lag slightly behind lived action, not race ahead of it.

## Types of Narratives

### Primary Narratives

Primary narratives are short, externally usable descriptions suitable for casual or professional contexts. They answer simple social questions without requiring depth or justification.

Their function is clarity, not disclosure.

### Extended Narratives

Extended narratives are used with trusted people and for personal reflection. They provide more context about motivations, tensions, and constraints, but remain factual rather than confessional.

Their function is connection, not catharsis.

## Relationship to Other CORE Elements

* **Drivers** define what must be true for engagement
* **Missions** define what I am responsible for addressing
* **Goals/Projects** define what I am currently doing
* **Narratives** define how I make that intelligible

Narratives do not justify actions. They describe them.

## Design Principles

Narratives should be:

* True in the present tense
* Simple enough to remember
* Stable across short time horizons
* Easy to revise when reality changes

If a narrative feels aspirational, defensive, or performative, it is likely no longer accurate and should be revised.

---

## Constraint on Narratives

Narratives must never be used to compensate for lack of action.

If reality is thin, narratives should be thin.
If reality changes, narratives should follow.

Narratives exist to reflect a coherent life, not to manufacture one.
