# GOALS

### Purpose

Goals translate missions into **specific, time-bound commitments**.

A goal defines a concrete change in the state of the world that I commit to making true within a given horizon. Goals exist to create evidence, not motivation.

A goal answers:

> **“What will be objectively different if I am making real progress?”**

### What Goals Do

1. **Define Progress Precisely**
   Goals make progress observable and falsifiable. They prevent drift, narrative inflation, and endless preparation.

2. **Create Compounding Nodes**
   Each completed goal should raise the baseline for future effort, making subsequent progress easier or more credible.

3. **Provide Closure**
   Goals include explicit finish lines that allow vigilance to disengage once the commitment has been met.

4. **Generate Learning**
   Success or failure both yield information that improves future goal selection.

### What Goals Are Not

* Not identities or aspirations
* Not moral judgments
* Not permanent commitments
* Not plans for how work will be done

Goals are instruments, not verdicts.

## Relationship Between Missions and Goals

* **Drivers** define operating requirements (what must be true)
* **Problems** describe where those requirements are violated
* **Missions** define directional responsibility in response
* **Goals** commit to specific, testable change
* **Projects** are where the work happens
* **Constraints** protect execution integrity

A mission without goals drifts.
A goal without a mission fragments.

Together, missions and goals allow action to be both *meaningful* and *real*.

## Design Principles

### Missions should be:

* Few in number
* Problem-rooted
* Directional rather than prescriptive
* Stable across medium time horizons

### Goals should be:

* Time-bound
* Observable
* Driver-legitimate
* Explicitly finishable

If a goal cannot be clearly marked “done,” it is not a goal.
If a mission no longer corresponds to a real problem, it should be revised or retired.
