# What are Constraints

## Purpose

This section defines the standing behavioral rules that govern my actions when pressure appears. Constraints exist to prevent predictable failure modes from reasserting themselves during moments of stress, uncertainty, or low energy.

Constraints are not plans, goals, or habits. They are **control logic**: simple, durable rules that override default behavior when known problems surface.

They are designed to reduce cognitive load, not increase it.

## Core Distinction

> **If it has a finish line, it’s a goal.**
> **If it has a trigger, it’s a constraint.**

This distinction is foundational to the TELOS system.

* Goals define *what must become true* within a time horizon.
* Constraints define *what happens when things start to go wrong*.

If a rule cannot be tied to a specific, observable trigger, it does not belong in this section.

---

## What Constraints Are

A constraint is a **standing behavioral rule** that:

* Activates automatically when a known trigger is detected
* Removes options or forces a specific response
* Overrides judgment during moments of pressure
* Remains valid even when motivation, clarity, or energy are low

Constraints are meant to feel slightly restrictive but relieving. If a rule feels inspiring, aspirational, or identity-affirming, it is likely misclassified.

---

## What Constraints Are Not

Constraints are **not**:

* Strategies in the conventional sense
* Plans of action or roadmaps
* Habits maintained for their own sake
* Moral rules or value statements
* Aspirational identity commitments

Constraints do not require continuous awareness or self-monitoring. If a rule demands vigilance to uphold, it violates the purpose of this section.

---

## Challenges vs Triggers

Constraints respond to **triggers**, not to challenges directly.

* **Challenges** are persistent, structural failure modes observed over time (e.g. chronic vigilance, abandonment of projects).
* **Triggers** are immediate, experiential signals that a challenge is active *right now*.

Think of the relationship like this:

```
Challenge = the underlying fault line
Trigger   = the tremor you can feel
Constraint = the automatic response
```

Constraints remain dormant until a trigger appears. This allows them to operate without constant vigilance.

---

## Triggers

A trigger is a specific, observable condition such as:

* An urge to delay, avoid, or switch tasks
* Starting to plan a second project
* Avoiding the definition of a finish line
* Feeling a spike of anxiety about failure or adequacy
* Reaching for distraction instead of engaging with work

Triggers are not prevented. They are expected.

Constraints define what happens *when* they occur.

---

## Adding New Constraints

New constraints are not invented proactively. They are added only when:

1. A failure pattern has appeared more than once in real work
2. The trigger can be clearly named
3. The default behavior under that trigger is known
4. A simple rule can reliably interrupt that behavior

If a failure has occurred only once, it does not earn a constraint.

This keeps the system lean and prevents over-engineering.

---

## Relationship to Other Sections

* **Drivers** define what a life costs
* **Problems** define what hurts
* **Challenges** define where things break
* **Goals** define what must become true
* **Constraints** define what is not allowed to happen
* **Projects** define where work occurs

Constraints protect goals. Goals give constraints something worth protecting.

## Design Principle

The best constraint is one you forget about—because it quietly prevents you from doing the wrong thing at the moment it would have mattered most.
