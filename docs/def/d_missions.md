# MISSIONS & GOALS

This document defines the role of **Missions** and **Goals** within CORE. Together, they translate operating requirements (Drivers) into directional intent and concrete change, without collapsing into aspiration, identity, or over-planning.

## MISSIONS

### Purpose

Missions define **directional responsibility**.

A mission describes how I am choosing to *respond* to persistent problems and violated drivers over a meaningful span of life. It is not a promise of success, but a declaration of where effort will be aimed.

A mission answers:

> **“Given how I am built and what is currently broken, what am I responsible for addressing?”**

### What Missions Do

1. **Provide Direction Without Prescription**
   Missions orient effort without specifying tactics, timelines, or outcomes. They allow many possible goals while preserving coherence.

2. **Bind Problems to Action**
   Missions exist because something matters and is unresolved. They connect lived problems to intentional response.

3. **Stabilize Identity Without Fixing It**
   Missions offer a stable sense of *what I am about right now* without hardening into permanent self-definition.

4. **Constrain Goal Selection**
   Goals are only legitimate if they clearly advance at least one active mission.

### What Missions Are Not

* Not goals (no finish line)
* Not values or ideals
* Not identities (“this is who I am”)
* Not plans or strategies

Missions can evolve or conclude when the underlying problems meaningfully change.
