# Projects

Projects are long‑running, concrete efforts that meaningfully advance one or more goals. A project exists to create **irreversible reality**: shipped artifacts, embodied capability, or durable structural change.

Projects are allowed to evolve, but they must always remain subordinate to **Goals** and constrained by active **Strategies**. They are not containers for indefinite exploration, self‑definition, or parallel ambition.

At this stage, the project list is intentionally small.
