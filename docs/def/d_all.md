# Definitions for the Core Project

## Telos

Within CORE, telos refers to the directional endpoint that becomes visible when actions, constraints, and commitments remain coherent over time.

**Telos is not specified in advance.** It is the revealed aim of a system whose operation is internally consistent.

---

## CORE

CORE is a tool for maintaining explainable, legitimate, and coherent action across time.
It is an operating structure that helps to understand what I am doing, why I am doing it, and whether it belongs — at any moment.

It provides:
- Explainability: the ability to trace actions and projects back to drivers and missions
- Legitimacy: clear constraints on what kinds of actions are worth taking
- Generativity: a framework for defining new goals and projects without drift or self-deception
- Continuity: mechanisms that allow effort to compound into a coherent life rather than fragment

## What CORE is not

- CORE is not perfect. Even after years of working on it, it will only contain some reasonable approximation of who you are. It is not your lived reality. For instance, you might think that getting a DRIVER wrong could cause a catastrofic collapse of the CORE, but it should rather reveal itself as you find yourself in conflict with it, thus spurring change and understanding.
- **CORE is not a productivity system and not a philosophy.**
- CORE is not an escape into psycho-babble. It is not expansive, and it only contains what is needed for **useful** guidance.
- CORE is not a personality test. While it explains your actions through a boiled down set of drivers, missions and rules, it does not try to fit you into a type.
- CORE is not a sure-fire way to stop lying to yourself. Its a way to recover explainability from action to drivers, whether those drivers and actions are truthful or not.

## DRIVERS

### Purpose

Drivers define the **conditions under which my life feels real, meaningful, and legitimate**.

They are *not* goals and they are not moral rules. They are the system's **operating requirements**: when they are met, I tend to engage freely and coherently with life; when they are violated, I predictably drift, harden, or collapse.

A driver answers:

> **"What must be continuously true for me to be awake, capable, and open to life?"**

---

### What Drivers Do

1. **Enable engagement**
   Drivers describe what restores aliveness, agency, and openness. They are not only about preventing failure; they specify the conditions that make full participation possible.

2. **Define legitimacy**
   Any goal or project is legitimate only if both its pursuit and its outcomes respect the drivers. Progress that violates them is treated as false progress.

3. **Expose tradeoffs**
   Drivers make costs explicit. Because time, energy, and attention are finite, choosing one way of living excludes others. Drivers clarify which tradeoffs are acceptable.

4. **Stabilize coherence over time**
   Drivers are stable. They allow goals and projects to change without losing integrity, because the operating requirements remain constant.

---

### What Drivers Are Not

* Not outcomes (no finish line)
* Not identity claims ("I am the kind of person who…")
* Not strategies/constraints (no triggers or enforcement rules)
* Not metrics

Drivers are **conditions**, not achievements.

---

### "Drivers Define What Life Costs" (and What Life Enables)

Every life pays a price: in time, attention, energy, integrity, health, and relationship. Violating a driver may produce short-term gains, but it accumulates debt (fatigue, resentment, confusion, isolation).

At the same time, drivers are not only about sacrifice. They are also about **what becomes possible** when the costs are paid: clarity, capacity, ownership, and closeness.

A practical reframe:

* **Drivers define what I refuse to pay unconsciously.**
* **Drivers define what I want to be able to access consistently.**

---

### Relationship to Other CORE Elements

* **Drivers**: operating requirements (what must be true)
* **Problems**: where those requirements are currently violated
* **Challenges**: recurring failure modes that block consistency
* **Constraints**: trigger-based rules that protect the drivers under stress
* **Goals/Projects**: commitments and work that must remain driver-legitimate

If a goal conflicts with a driver, the goal is illegitimate by definition.

---

### Design Principles

Drivers should be:

* Few
* Stable across time
* Expensive to violate
* Easy to recognize when broken

If a condition can be ignored repeatedly without consequence, it is not a driver.

---

## MISSIONS & GOALS

This document defines the role of **Missions** and **Goals** within CORE. Together, they translate operating requirements (Drivers) into directional intent and concrete change, without collapsing into aspiration, identity, or over-planning.

---

### MISSIONS

#### Purpose

Missions define **directional responsibility**.

A mission describes how I am choosing to *respond* to persistent problems and violated drivers over a meaningful span of life. It is not a promise of success, but a declaration of where effort will be aimed.

A mission answers:

> **"Given how I am built and what is currently broken, what am I responsible for addressing?"**

---

#### What Missions Do

1. **Provide Direction Without Prescription**
   Missions orient effort without specifying tactics, timelines, or outcomes. They allow many possible goals while preserving coherence.

2. **Bind Problems to Action**
   Missions exist because something matters and is unresolved. They connect lived problems to intentional response.

3. **Stabilize Identity Without Fixing It**
   Missions offer a stable sense of *what I am about right now* without hardening into permanent self-definition.

4. **Constrain Goal Selection**
   Goals are only legitimate if they clearly advance at least one active mission.

---

#### What Missions Are Not

* Not goals (no finish line)
* Not values or ideals
* Not identities ("this is who I am")
* Not plans or strategies

Missions can evolve or conclude when the underlying problems meaningfully change.

---

## NARRATIVES

### Purpose

Narratives define the **working stories** I use to understand myself and to communicate who I am to others.

They are not aspirations, branding, or identity construction. Narratives exist to **stabilize coherence**, reduce fragmentation, and allow truthful communication without over‑disclosure or self‑distortion.

A narrative answers:

> **"How do I explain what I am doing and why, in a way that is accurate, grounded, and sustainable?"**

---

### What Narratives Do

1. **Maintain Internal Coherence**
   Narratives provide a stable frame that connects current actions to missions and drivers. They prevent constant re‑interpretation of the self every time circumstances change.

2. **Enable Honest External Communication**
   Narratives allow me to speak about my life and work without exaggeration, defensiveness, or unnecessary complexity. They are socially legible without being performative.

3. **Reduce Cognitive and Emotional Load**
   By having a small set of ready narratives, I avoid repeatedly renegotiating who I am or what I am about in each interaction.

4. **Prevent Drift and Self‑Deception**
   Narratives act as mirrors. If my actions stop matching my narratives, the mismatch becomes visible quickly.

---

### What Narratives Are Not

Narratives are **not**:

* Goals or plans
* Values or virtues
* Fixed identities
* Personal mythology
* Optimized self‑presentation

Narratives are allowed to change as reality changes. They should lag slightly behind lived action, not race ahead of it.

---

### Types of Narratives

#### Primary Narratives

Primary narratives are short, externally usable descriptions suitable for casual or professional contexts. They answer simple social questions without requiring depth or justification.

Their function is clarity, not disclosure.

#### Extended Narratives

Extended narratives are used with trusted people and for personal reflection. They provide more context about motivations, tensions, and constraints, but remain factual rather than confessional.

Their function is connection, not catharsis.

---

### Relationship to Other CORE Elements

* **Drivers** define what must be true for engagement
* **Missions** define what I am responsible for addressing
* **Goals/Projects** define what I am currently doing
* **Narratives** define how I make that intelligible

Narratives do not justify actions. They describe them.

---

### Design Principles

Narratives should be:

* True in the present tense
* Simple enough to remember
* Stable across short time horizons
* Easy to revise when reality changes

If a narrative feels aspirational, defensive, or performative, it is likely no longer accurate and should be revised.

---

### Constraint on Narratives

Narratives must never be used to compensate for lack of action.

If reality is thin, narratives should be thin.
If reality changes, narratives should follow.

Narratives exist to reflect a coherent life, not to manufacture one.

---

### GOALS

#### Purpose

Goals translate missions into **specific, time-bound commitments**.

A goal defines a concrete change in the state of the world that I commit to making true within a given horizon. Goals exist to create evidence, not motivation.

A goal answers:

> **"What will be objectively different if I am making real progress?"**

---

#### What Goals Do

1. **Define Progress Precisely**
   Goals make progress observable and falsifiable. They prevent drift, narrative inflation, and endless preparation.

2. **Create Compounding Nodes**
   Each completed goal should raise the baseline for future effort, making subsequent progress easier or more credible.

3. **Provide Closure**
   Goals include explicit finish lines that allow vigilance to disengage once the commitment has been met.

4. **Generate Learning**
   Success or failure both yield information that improves future goal selection.

---

#### What Goals Are Not

* Not identities or aspirations
* Not moral judgments
* Not permanent commitments
* Not plans for how work will be done

Goals are instruments, not verdicts.

---

### Relationship Between Missions and Goals

* **Drivers** define operating requirements (what must be true)
* **Problems** describe where those requirements are violated
* **Missions** define directional responsibility in response
* **Goals** commit to specific, testable change
* **Projects** are where the work happens
* **Constraints** protect execution integrity

A mission without goals drifts.
A goal without a mission fragments.

Together, missions and goals allow action to be both *meaningful* and *real*.

---

### Design Principles

#### Missions should be:

* Few in number
* Problem-rooted
* Directional rather than prescriptive
* Stable across medium time horizons

#### Goals should be:

* Time-bound
* Observable
* Driver-legitimate
* Explicitly finishable

If a goal cannot be clearly marked "done," it is not a goal.
If a mission no longer corresponds to a real problem, it should be revised or retired.

---

## CHALLENGES

Challenges describe the recurring systemic impediments that reliably break the chain between intention and sustained action. They are not moral failures, personality flaws, or a lack of willpower. They are structural bottlenecks that distort behavior even when values, goals, and capability are clear.

Within the TELOS framework, challenges are useful because they:
- Explain why progress stalls despite clarity and competence
- Identify where real leverage exists
- Prevent misattributing systemic issues to character defects
- Enable strategies to be designed against reality rather than ideals

A challenge is considered valid if it:
- Appears across multiple domains of life
- Persists over time
- Cannot be resolved by a single decision
- Predictably undermines execution, recovery, or coherence

---

## CONSTRAINTS

### Purpose

This section defines the standing behavioral rules that govern my actions when pressure appears. Constraints exist to prevent predictable failure modes from reasserting themselves during moments of stress, uncertainty, or low energy.

Constraints are not plans, goals, or habits. They are **control logic**: simple, durable rules that override default behavior when known problems surface.

They are designed to reduce cognitive load, not increase it.

---

### Core Distinction

> **If it has a finish line, it's a goal.**
> **If it has a trigger, it's a constraint.**

This distinction is foundational to the TELOS system.

* Goals define *what must become true* within a time horizon.
* Constraints define *what happens when things start to go wrong*.

If a rule cannot be tied to a specific, observable trigger, it does not belong in this section.

---

### What Constraints Are

A constraint is a **standing behavioral rule** that:

* Activates automatically when a known trigger is detected
* Removes options or forces a specific response
* Overrides judgment during moments of pressure
* Remains valid even when motivation, clarity, or energy are low

Constraints are meant to feel slightly restrictive but relieving. If a rule feels inspiring, aspirational, or identity-affirming, it is likely misclassified.

---

### What Constraints Are Not

Constraints are **not**:

* Strategies in the conventional sense
* Plans of action or roadmaps
* Habits maintained for their own sake
* Moral rules or value statements
* Aspirational identity commitments

Constraints do not require continuous awareness or self-monitoring. If a rule demands vigilance to uphold, it violates the purpose of this section.

---

### Challenges vs Triggers

Constraints respond to **triggers**, not to challenges directly.

* **Challenges** are persistent, structural failure modes observed over time (e.g. chronic vigilance, abandonment of projects).
* **Triggers** are immediate, experiential signals that a challenge is active *right now*.

Think of the relationship like this:

```
Challenge = the underlying fault line
Trigger   = the tremor you can feel
Constraint = the automatic response
```

Constraints remain dormant until a trigger appears. This allows them to operate without constant vigilance.

---

### Triggers

A trigger is a specific, observable condition such as:

* An urge to delay, avoid, or switch tasks
* Starting to plan a second project
* Avoiding the definition of a finish line
* Feeling a spike of anxiety about failure or adequacy
* Reaching for distraction instead of engaging with work

Triggers are not prevented. They are expected.

Constraints define what happens *when* they occur.

---

### Adding New Constraints

New constraints are not invented proactively. They are added only when:

1. A failure pattern has appeared more than once in real work
2. The trigger can be clearly named
3. The default behavior under that trigger is known
4. A simple rule can reliably interrupt that behavior

If a failure has occurred only once, it does not earn a constraint.

This keeps the system lean and prevents over-engineering.

---

### Relationship to Other Sections

* **Drivers** define what a life costs
* **Problems** define what hurts
* **Challenges** define where things break
* **Goals** define what must become true
* **Constraints** define what is not allowed to happen
* **Projects** define where work occurs

Constraints protect goals. Goals give constraints something worth protecting.

---

### Design Principle

The best constraint is one you forget about—because it quietly prevents you from doing the wrong thing at the moment it would have mattered most.

---

## PROJECTS

Projects are long‑running, concrete efforts that meaningfully advance one or more goals. A project exists to create **irreversible reality**: shipped artifacts, embodied capability, or durable structural change.

Projects are allowed to evolve, but they must always remain subordinate to **Goals** and constrained by active **Strategies**. They are not containers for indefinite exploration, self‑definition, or parallel ambition.

At this stage, the project list is intentionally small.
