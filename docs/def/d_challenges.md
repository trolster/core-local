# What are Challenges?

Challenges describe the recurring systemic impediments that reliably break the chain between intention and sustained action. They are not moral failures, personality flaws, or a lack of willpower. They are structural bottlenecks that distort behavior even when values, goals, and capability are clear.

Within the TELOS framework, challenges are useful because they:
- Explain why progress stalls despite clarity and competence
- Identify where real leverage exists
- Prevent misattributing systemic issues to character defects
- Enable strategies to be designed against reality rather than ideals

A challenge is considered valid if it:
- Appears across multiple domains of life
- Persists over time
- Cannot be resolved by a single decision
- Predictably undermines execution, recovery, or coherence
